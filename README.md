The Haskell ABS tree for ArchLinux
====================================

This project contains the database used to generate an ABS tree of ArchLinux
PKGBUILDs.  These PKGBUILDs can then be used to compile a binary repository of
Haskell packages.  If you want to use the official build of this repository
then add the following two lines to your `/etc/pacman.conf` file:

    [haskell-core]
    Server =  http://xsounds.org/~haskell/core/$arch

If you'd like to build the repository yourself, then you need to install the
following packages:

* `devtools`
* `cblrepo` (available in \[haskell-core\], and from [hackageDB][1])
* `zsh`
* `git`

The packages and database are signed with the following key:

    pub   2048D/4209170B 2012-12-26
          Key fingerprint = F310 4992 EBF2 4EB8 72B9  7B9C 32B0 B453 4209 170B
    uid                  ArchHaskell (Magnus Therning) <magnus@therning.org>
    sub   2048D/A418C0FE 2012-12-26


Build steps
-----------

First clone the database in this repository:

    % git clone git://github.com/archhaskell/habs.git
    % cd habs

Then sync the cabal index:

    % cblrepo sync

Then create all the PKGBUILDs for the packages:

    % cblrepo pkgbuild $(cblrepo build base|tail -n +2)

that should fill up the directory with directories containing PKGBUILDs, one
for each package.  To build packages use the script `makeahpkg`.  There's a
builtin help:

    % ./makeahpkg -h
    Usage: makeahpkg [options] -- [packages]
    
    Run this script in your HABS dir to build the named packages inside a
    chroot.
    
    The chroot dir consists of two dirs, a pristine chroot (root), and a build
    chroot (build).  This script handles both of them.
    
    Options:
    -h          This help
    -c          Clean the build chroot before building
    -x          Update the pristine chroot first (implies -c)
    -l <dir>    Location of chroot (default .)
    -a <arch>   Architecture to build for i686 or x86_64 (default is local arch)
    -b <dir>    Location of your HABS dir (default .)

To build all the packages:

    % ./makeahpkg -c -- $(cblrepo build base | tail -n +2)

The script will create a clean ArchLinx installation in a chroot environment
at `./${arch}-chroot`, where `${arch}` is either `i686` or `x86_64`, depending
on your hardware.  Use the option `-l <dir>` to put the chroot in a different
location.  It is also possible to cross-compile the i686 repository on 64-bit
machines by using the `-a` option.

All PKGBUILDs in the project must be generated with the latest release of
[cblrepo][6].

The ArchHaskell project
=======================

The main goal is to maintain a binary repository of up-to-date packages taken
from [hackageDB][1].  To achieve this we also maintain several repositories of
tools, libraries, and scripts:

* [cblrepo][6] is the main tool used to maintain a consistent database of
  package versions and generate PKGBUILDs.
* [cabal2arch][2] is a tool which converts a CABAL file into a PKGBUILD, and
  optionally a `.install`. (Currently only used for packages not included in
  the database, e.g. for generating source packages to upload to AUR.)
* [archlinux][3] is the main dependency of `cabal2arch`.
* [archlinux-web][4] contains a library and a set of scripts that help with
  various web-related tasks such as updating the information on [hackageDB][1]
  on what versions of packages that are available for ArchLinux.

All discussion around our HABS tree and other packages take place on the
[ArchHaskell mailinglist][5].

The available packages
======================

Currently the repository contains some 200 packages, which is only a small
fraction of the packages on [hackageDB][1].  We would of course like to cover
100% of [hackageDB][1], but our resources, tools and processes don't allow it
yet.

Choosing of the current set
--------------------------

The current set of packages was chosen in a very unstructured way, and we are
still discussing how to decide what packages we take on.  Please get involved
by joining the [mailinglist][5] if you have opinions on how we should pick the
packages we provide.

Adding individual packages
--------------------------

Suggestions for adding individual packages to the set are always welcome.
Use the [github issue tracker][5] to make sure your request isn't lost.  Be
aware though that each added package adds to the burden of the team, so there
is a real risk that your request is denied.  That risk is reduced if you show
an interest in contributing to the project, e.g. by providing already built
packages together with your request..

Contributing
------------

1. Fork it.
2. (Maybe) Create a new branch.
3. Make the required changes. (Adding packages, patches etc.)
4. Build packages for **both** `i686` and `x86_64`.
5. Upload the built packages to someplace where the maintainers can get them. (e.g. Dropbox)
6. Push the changes to your fork.
7. Create a pull request mentioning the url from which the package can be downloaded.
